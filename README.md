What it does:
Inserting the city name or letting geo location determine it, it gives you the current weather.

This first version is essentially the tutorial from visual studio, with a few modifications like:
* Instead of using zip codes, using city name
* It's configured right now just for cities in Portugal
* Added some code to display icons for the weather

Currently I'm learning more about the weather api http://openweathermap.org/ so I can use forecast for several days.
